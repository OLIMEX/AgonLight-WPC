Hello.

Attached is my entry for the OLIMEX AgonLight Week Programming Challenge â€“ ISSUE 4, which I have named "TINACOT", a recursive acronym which stands for "TINACOT is not a clone of Tetris".  

TINACOT is written in AgonLight's BBC BASIC.  Although inspired by Tetris, it truly is not a clone of Tetris, but an original game of its own, whose gameplay at times can seem just as hectic as Tetris. 

HOW TO PLAY:
The object of TINACOT is to complete a randomly generated sequence of colored game pieces by allowing colored game pieces that are advancing from the four orthogonal sides of the playing field to reach the center of the playing field.  Advancing game pieces which reach the center of the playing field need to match the color and shape of the current target position in the sequence of game pieces shown at the top of the screen.  If a non-matching game piece reaches the center of the playing field, the game ends as a loss.  Advancing game pieces which do not match the color and shape of the current target piece may be repelled.  This is done by pressing the arrow key on the keyboard which opposes the direction of the offending game piece.  If by mistake a game piece is repelled which matches the current target piece in the sequence, then the game ends as a loss; so care should be taken when multiple matching pieces are advancing simultaneously toward the center of the playing field not to repel any of those matching pieces until the closest one of them reaches the center of the playing field.  Five levels worth of sequences must be completed for the game to end as a win.

I hope you enjoy playing TINACOT as much as I enjoyed creating it.


Cheers.
Tony
