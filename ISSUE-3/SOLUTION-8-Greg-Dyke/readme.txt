Good evening Tsvetan, Bernado,

Attaching the zipped binary and image assets for my submission to this week's Snake challenge (sd_files.zip). The snake.bin expects to be in the root of your SD, and the "snake_assets" directory also expects to be at the root.

You can fully replace the game image assets with any other 32-bit bitmap files you like as the code parses and uploads normal BMP files from SD. I'm not at all an artist so I used Clear_code's freely public domain imagery (https://opengameart.org/content/snake-game-assets).

Because you asked that submissions run on a stock Agon Light I've had to stick with the 320x200x75Hz resolution for 64 colours instead of 320x240x60Hz mode that a lot of us have modified our Agons to use, which means it might not sync properly with a modern monitor (on mine it cuts off the far side), sorry!

Also attaching the C source for the game.

Sadly I didn't have as much time to work on this as I'd hoped, as I'd originally intended to include levels with different arrangements of blocks that kill the snake if collided with and different backgrounds, as well as some basic background music (or the best you can do on a stock Agon Light), but hopefully this is enjoyable enough!

Regards,

Greg
