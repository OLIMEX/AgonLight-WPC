Hello Tsvetan:

Attached is my entry for the weekend programming challenge, which I have named "Snac-Snake".    It is still very much a work in progress.  

The game is written in AgonLight's BBC BASIC.  

It actually plays much better on BBC BASIC SDL, so be sure to also check it out in there, if you can, to see what I mean.  The keyboard input on the AgonLight can be laggy and the GET$ command is not working consistently (such that much of the collision-detection code in my game which relies on GET$ is not working properly on the AgonLight).  This has me wondering if there are still some lingering issues with the communication between the CPU and the VDP.


Thank you for hosting these challenges.  They are a lot of fun!

Cheers.
Tony
