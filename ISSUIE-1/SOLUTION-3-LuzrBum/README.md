Dear Olimex & team,

My submission for this challenge https://olimex.wordpress.com/2023/04/21/agonlight-weekend-programming-challenge-issue-1/ is published here https://github.com/LuzrBum/Agon-Projects/blob/main/SIMON.bbc

I have also made a video explaining the "creation" ðŸ˜‰ process, it will be made public at midnight on Sunday https://youtu.be/oXMx9FPrQQU so as not to interfere with the contest.

Kind regards,
LuzrBum
